# SkinnerTrax
High-throughput behavior-dependent optogenetic stimulation of Drosophila.  Our paper [Learning a Spatial Task by Trial and Error in _Drosophila_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.06.045) that uses SkinnerTrax just became available online, and we expect to make the SkinnerTrax code available the week of 4 August 2019.
